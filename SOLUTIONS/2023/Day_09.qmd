```{julia}
#| label: setup
#| include: false
using Markdown;
```

## The input

Sequences of numbers.

```{julia}
#| label: read_data
root = dirname(@__FILE__);
input_file = joinpath(root, "..", "..", "DATA", "2023", "input_day09.txt");
#input_file = joinpath(root, "..", "..", "DATA", "2023", "example_input_day09.txt");
input_data = read(open(input_file, "r"), String);
```

```{julia}
input_data = split(input_data, "\n") |>
    x -> split.(x, " ");
input_data = broadcast(x -> parse.(Int64, x), input_data[1:(end - 1)])
```

## Part 1

### The problem and solution

Gather all the last differences and extrapolate another number in each sequence.

```{julia}
next_num_in_seq = Int64[];
for cur_seq in input_data
    last_differences = Int64[];

    cur_diff = diff(cur_seq);
    while !all(cur_diff .== 0)
        push!(last_differences, cur_diff[end]);
        cur_diff = diff(cur_diff);
    end

    push!(last_differences, cur_seq[end]);
    next_diff = 0;
    for i in last_differences
        next_diff += i;
    end
    push!(next_num_in_seq, next_diff);
end
```

```{julia}
#| echo: false
Markdown.parse("""
The sum of the extrapolated values is: $(sum(next_num_in_seq)).
""")
```


# Part 2

### The problem and solution

Gather all the first differences and extrapolate previous number in each sequence.

```{julia}
prev_num_in_seq = Int64[];
for cur_seq in input_data
    first_differences = Int64[];

    cur_diff = diff(cur_seq);
    while !all(cur_diff .== 0)
        push!(first_differences, cur_diff[begin]);
        cur_diff = diff(cur_diff);
    end

    first_differences = first_differences[end:-1:1];
    push!(first_differences, cur_seq[begin]);
    prev_diff = 0;
    for i in first_differences
        prev_diff = i - prev_diff;
    end
    push!(prev_num_in_seq, prev_diff);
end
```

```{julia}
#| echo: false
Markdown.parse("""
The sum of the extrapolated values is: $(sum(prev_num_in_seq)).
""")
```
